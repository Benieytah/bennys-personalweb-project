                    <p> As a developer, I have various aspirations for my tech goals in the coming years but here are a few I hope to get done in the next two years.
                        First and foremost, I aim to master my skills to achieve level 10 and successfully complete the HNG internship, ensuring I gain valuable practical experience along the way.
                         Additionally, I am focused on securing a rewarding remote front-end developer position with an international company, ideally with a visa relocation offer. While 
                        I am open to starting locally to strengthen my CV and build confidence in my abilities, I also plan to actively engage in both offline and online public speaking tech events. 
                        Through these engagements, I aim to refine my public speaking skills and share knowledge, particularly with young girls aspiring to pursue careers in male-dominated fields.
                         Furthermore, I am committed to attending various tech conferences to stay updated on industry trends, learn from experts, and expand my professional network.
                         Finally, I recognize the importance of continuous learning in a tech career path. 
                        I will enhance my skill set through self-study, online courses, and hands-on projects, aiming to grow as a developer and potentially advance into back-end development.
